## Kyrie's Cabinet of Curiosities 

1. Compiler for FL (computation+communication)

2. Is it possible to adopt imitation learning or other IRL approaches to mimic DNN compiler generated kernels,,, shortening long tuning process, boosting cross-device compiling?

3. NeRF, Q4ML, ML4Q, QCompiler... dazzled

4. Sim2Real Runtime Engine, for e.g. [MinDOJO](https://github.com/MineDojo/MineDojo), autonomous driving?[X], nature of simulation: massive data, exploration cost, distributed traing <-> real.
