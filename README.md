## Kyrie's Cabinet of Curiosities 

1. Compiler for FL (computation+communication)

2. Is it possible to adopt imitation learning or other IRL approaches to mimic DNN compiler generated kernels,,, shortening long tuning process, boosting cross-device compiling?

3. NeRF, Q4ML, ML4Q, QCompiler... dazzled, [Closing the Gap between Quantum Algorithms and Machines with Hardware-Software Co-Design](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/Chong-QC-UCLA19.pdf)

4. Sim2Real Runtime Engine, for e.g. [MinDOJO](https://github.com/MineDojo/MineDojo), autonomous driving?[X], nature of simulation: massive data, exploration cost, distributed traing <-> real.
